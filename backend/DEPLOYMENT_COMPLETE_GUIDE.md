## üì¶ STEP 3: POPULATE DATABASE WITH SAMPLE DATA

### Method 1: Run Seed Script Locally (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Activate virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux

# Run comprehensive data seeding
python seed_comprehensive_data.py
```

### Method 2: Use Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Connect to your project
railway link

# Run seed script on Railway
railway run python seed_comprehensive_data.py
```

### Method 3: Via API Endpoint (Development Only)

```bash
# Make POST request to seed endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/seed/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

---

## üéØ STEP 4: VERIFY DEPLOYMENT

### A. Check Health Status
Visit: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health/`

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "OK",
  "cache": "OK",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### B. Check Admin Panel
1. Visit: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/`
2. Should redirect to admin login
3. Login with: `admin` / `admin123`
4. Verify all models are visible and populated

### C. Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Get JWT token
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'

# Test products endpoint
curl -X GET https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/catalog/products/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```
