```

### **Configuration Management**
```python
# Comprehensive payment gateway configuration
PAYMENT_GATEWAYS = {
    'STRIPE': {
        'ENABLED': True,
        'API_VERSION': '2023-10-16',
        'SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES': ['USD', 'EUR', 'GBP', 'CAD', 'AUD', 'JPY'],
        # ... extensive configuration options
    }
}
```

## üîÑ Atomic Transaction Examples

### **Payment Creation with Rollback Protection**
```python
@transaction.atomic
def create_payment_intent(self, request: PaymentRequest):
    try:
        # Create Stripe payment intent
        stripe_intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(...)
        
        # Create database record
        payment = Payment.objects.create(...)
        
        # Update invoice status
        if payment.invoice:
            payment.invoice.payment_status = 'PROCESSING'
            payment.invoice.save()
        
        return PaymentResponse(success=True, ...)
    except Exception as e:
        # Automatic rollback on any failure
        logger.error(f"Payment creation failed: {e}")
        return PaymentResponse(success=False, ...)
```

### **Webhook Processing with Atomic Updates**
```python
@transaction.atomic
def _handle_payment_succeeded(self, event_data, webhook_event):
    # Select payment with lock to prevent race conditions
    payment = Payment.objects.select_for_update().get(
        gateway_payment_id=payment_intent_id
    )
    
    # Atomic status updates
    payment.status = Payment.Status.COMPLETED
    payment.paid_at = timezone.now()
    payment.save()
    
    # Update related invoice atomically
    if payment.invoice:
        payment.invoice.payment_status = 'PAID'
        payment.invoice.save()
    
    # Send confirmation email
    send_email(...)
```
